This is the interface for fitting
The fitting part is the simplist and the most complicated part.
The basic usage should be :

    fit(data, model, variables, parameters, options)

data should be a TTree
model should be a class that contains the function to call
variables are the random variables
options are the other options

But from the experience of roofit, more details should be considered.
